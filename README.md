An alternative to Delphi's built-in “Units…” and “Forms…” dialogs. Also includes ProjectSwitcher and ComponentSwitcher. All include:

* Incremental filtering (including multiple filter criteria by pressing Ctrl-Tab)
* Pretty colours!

##### UnitSwitcher

* Multiselect to open more than one unit at once
* Hold Shift to open the DFM for forms
* Filter units, forms and datamodules
* Sort by name or by type
* Toggle read-only for those cursed to work with locking version control

##### ProjectSwitcher

* Easily switch between projects in the group using the same incremental filtering

##### ComponentSwitcher

* Press Ctrl-F on a form or datamodule to search for a component by name
* Show or hide groups of components (for example, dataset fields)
* Customize component groups by specifying the class names
